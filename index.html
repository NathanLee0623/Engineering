    <h4 style="font-family:Courier New">This week we finished making our Rude-Goldberg machines out of cardboard. It included a baseball, an incline plane, a car with a ram, and a hammer-like lever with a needle on the end. At first we were originally just going to have a pole with a needle fall on the balloon, but decided to put it on a hinge so that we could control the direction it fell at all times. We tested them on friday. At first our machine didn't work because there wasn't enough force from the lever's fall to pop the balloon. So, we made the lever stand more upright to minimize the backwards force, and made the ram on the car wider to guarantee it hitting the lever even if it doesn't go straight. Our machine successfully popped the balloon on our second attempt.</h4>

However, in testing, our rocket seemed to be too top heavy because it just dipped forward instead of shooting up. It probably could have gone better if it was angled a little higher at the start, but we couldn't change that.</h4>

Lastly, we made the LED light blink when a button was pressed.</h4>

    <h4 style="font-family:Courier New">This week we started our civil engineering unit. We began our project to build bridges out of only 20 pieces of spaghetti to hold a bucket of water. Our first CAD (1st image) was based off of most of the bridges we found on the internet, including lots of triangles which we know create strong structures. However, it was to fragile because it used too many singular noodles which were too thin when we actually tried making it. So we made a second CAD (2nd image) with each segment having two noodles together to reinforce the structure. It was more simple with less triangles, but we needed to do so in order to make each segment thicker and stronger. We started gluing the model and are waiting for it to dry. </h4></h4>

    <h4 style="font-family:Courier New">This week we completed our 2nd design and tested it. It did not go well because part of our bridge snapped beforehand. We created a 3rd design which had every component with two pieces of spaghetti together. However we are saving this design for later and are working on a bridge which is just 20 pieces all clumped together. </h4> </h4>
