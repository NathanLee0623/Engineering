We first drew the outlines on a piece of cardboard, and then cut them out with a boxcutter. On Friday, we made paper boats and put weights on them to see how long they floated in water.</h4>

    <h4 style="font-family:Courier New">This week we finished making our Rude-Goldberg machines out of cardboard. It included a baseball, an incline plane, a car with a ram, and a hammer-like lever with a needle on the end. At first we were originally just going to have a pole with a needle fall on the balloon, but decided to put it on a hinge so that we could control the direction it fell at all times. We tested them on friday. At first our machine didn't work because there wasn't enough force from the lever's fall to pop the balloon. So, we made the lever stand more upright to minimize the backwards force, and made the ram on the car wider to guarantee it hitting the lever even if it doesn't go straight. Our machine successfully popped the balloon on our second attempt.</h4>

We also dissected a laptop, finding and labeling the parts such as the CPU, GPU, Heat Sink, Fan, etcetera. We also had to color in a worksheet while labeling various parts.</h4>

I modeled it based off of images of different bird prosthetics and human leg prosthetics. I decided to add the toes/claws for aesthetic and to increase footing and grip.</h4>

    <h4 style="font-family:Courier New"> This week we continued our bottle rocket construction. Our design consisted of a cone head for aerodynamics and 3 parallelogram fins because that's what a website said was ideal. However, in testing, our rocket seemed to be too top heavy because it just dipped forward instead of shooting up. It probably could have gone better if it was angled a little higher at the start, but we couldn't change that.</h4>

    <h4 style="font-family:Courier New">This week we continued in electrical engineering. We worked with actual circuits on a breadboard. An arduino connected to a laptop was used to power the breadboard. We had to create a parallel circuit, series circuit, and one with just resistors (in order in pictures). We then had to figure out the voltage at different points in the circuit using a multimeter.</h4>
