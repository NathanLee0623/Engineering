    <h4 style="font-family:Courier New">This week we learned about business engineering. We learned that there are various jobs regarding finances, laws, and aesthetic when it comes to engineered products, in order to give the consumer a good experience. We made a sales pitch on a procuct we imagined. Our group's product was Facial Recognition In Security Camera (FRISC), which was a door camera that used facial recognition to increase home security by identifying strangers or suspicous activity.</h4>

      This week we learned about chemical engineering. We learned about how chemical engineers work on scaling up chemical processes and engineering the machines to produce chemicals, such as medicines, beers, etcetera, whereas chemists work on 
      creating the actual chemical reactions. For our project we created a non-Newtonian fluid with cornstarch and water. It resulted in a fluid that acted as a solid with more force, and as a liquid with less force.
